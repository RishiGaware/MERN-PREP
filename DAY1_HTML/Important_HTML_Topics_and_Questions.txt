Important HTML Topics with Interview Questions

Topics:
1. Semantic HTML:

    Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags to describe the structure and purpose of web content.

    Example semantic tags:
    <header>, <footer>, <main>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <time>

    Why it's used (short):

    Improves SEO

    Improves accessibility (screen readers)

    Cleaner structure

    Easier maintenance



2. HTML5 Structural Elements:
    HTML5 structural elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>
    give meaning and structure to a webpage. They improve SEO, accessibility,
    and help browsers and developers understand the layout better compared to using only <div> tags.

3. Forms & Form Validation:
    Forms are used to collect user input on a webpage. HTML5 introduced new form elements and attributes for 
    better validation and user experience.

4. Input Types (email, number, date, file, etc.)
    HTML5 introduced new input types like email, number, date, file, etc. for better validation and user experience.

5. Accessibility (ARIA roles)
    ARIA roles are used to define the role of an element on a webpage. They improve accessibility for screen readers.
        ARIA roles improve accessibility by helping screen readers understand elements.
        - role="button" makes a non-button act like a button.
        aria-label adds a text label to icons or elements without visible text.
        aria-expanded tells whether a dropdown is open or closed.
        aria-controls links a button to the element it controls.
        aria-live announces dynamic content updates automatically.

6. SEO Basics (meta tags, title, description)
    Meta tags provide information about the webpage (like charset, SEO, responsiveness) and do not appear on the page.

7. Canvas & Multimedia Tags
    Canvas is used to draw graphics on a webpage. Multimedia tags like <audio> and <video> are used to add audio and video to a webpage.

8. HTML DOM Structure
  The HTML DOM is a tree-like structure of a webpage where each element becomes a node that JavaScript can access and modify.

9. Difference Between Block, Inline, Inline-Block:
    Block: Starts on a new line and takes full width.
    Inline: Stays in the same line and ignores width/height.
    Inline-block: Stays in the same line but allows width/height.

10. Attributes vs Properties
    Attributes are defined in the HTML markup, while properties are defined in the DOM.
        Attribute = what you write in HTML
        Property = what JavaScript can change while the page is running

11. LocalStorage vs SessionStorage vs Cookies:
    LocalStorage:
        Stores data permanently until manually deleted.
        Capacity: ~5MB.
        Not sent to server automatically.

    SessionStorage:
        Stores data only for the current tab session.
        Deletes when tab is closed.
        Not sent to server.

    Cookies:
        Small data stored with an expiration time and sent to the server with every request.
        Capacity: ~4KB.
        Used for authentication
        
12.Difference Between HTML vs HTML5:
    HTML is the older markup language, while HTML5 is the updated version with better semantics, 
    built-in audio/video support, canvas for graphics, improved forms, localStorage/sessionStorage, 
    and new APIs. HTML5 removes the need for plugins like Flash and makes pages more accessible and 
    SEO-friendly.

13.What is <!DOCTYPE html>, what are meta tags, and what does UTF-8 mean?
    <!DOCTYPE html> tells the browser to use HTML5 standards mode.
    Meta tags provide information about the webpage (like charset, SEO, responsiveness) and do not appear on the page.
    UTF-8 is a character encoding that supports all languages, symbols, and emojis.
